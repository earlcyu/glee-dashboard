# Glee Power BI Dashboard

This project aims to create a Power BI dashboard that illustrates information regarding the various covers that had been done on the TV series, Glee.

Specifically, this project aims to:
1. Extract data from the show's Wikipedia page
2. Transform and normalize data using Power Query 
3. Model the normalized data using a star schema 
4. Create charts that summarize information

## Context

As a Glee fan, I have always been curious how many covers the show has done the various details of these covers, such as which character did the most covers, which artist or band did the show cover the most, etc. 

Since I need to practice my Power Query skills, I decided to do this project to kill two birds with one stone. In doing so, I came across the topic of database normalization, which I implemented in Power Query as well. 

Once I had normalized the data, it was easy to create the necessary visualizations in Power BI.
